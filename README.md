# Deep Learning TFM

This repository contains the implementations for my Master's Final project (Trabajo de Fin de MÃ¡ster/TFM).

The project aims to develop a video-based recognition system for American Sign Language (ASL) letters using deep learning techniques with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks.
